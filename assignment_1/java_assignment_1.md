#### The Value of a Word

You objective is to calculate the ascii value of a word of your choice.
You have the option of using the String objects charAt() method to find the value of each letter or you may assign each letter to a char variable. Here is some example pseudo-code to give you an idea.

The word is **Beautiful**.

As individual chars variables:

    set char1 = 'B'
    set char2 = 'e'

Or with charAt():

    set beautifulString = "Beautiful"
    set firstChar = beautifulString.charAt(0)

Either one of these options is valid.

Your output will be an integer so you will need to convert each character to its **integer** to its **ascii** equivalent. Please refer to your class notes for help.
