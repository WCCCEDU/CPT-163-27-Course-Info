- Geek vs. Nerd      : I’ve never looked up these words in the dictionary so I may be surprised at what they actually mean. The online Merriam-Webster dictionary definitions for geek and nerd are:
 
    Geek:  a person who is socially awkward and unpopular : a usually intelligent person who does not fit in with other people : a person who is very interested in and knows a lot about a particular field or activity
 
    Nerd:  a person who behaves awkwardly around other people and usually has unstylish clothes, hair, etc. : a person who is very interested in technical subjects, computers, etc.
 
    No surprises, they are very similar to one another. Both geeks and nerds can be socially awkward resulting in being unpopular and may not look or dress stylishly. This is something they may have in common. I say “may” because not all geeks or nerds have these problems. I don’t believe there are any studies that report the percentage of such people that are socially awkward, unpopular, or do not look or dress stylishly but I have known a number of people who I would consider a geek or a nerd who do not display any of those traits. But then again, those traits are quite subjective.
 
    The last parts of the definitions are where the terms differ a bit. A geek is not necessarily a nerd but a nerd can also be a geek. A geek can be interested and knowledgeable about a particular field or activity whereas a nerd would be interested in one or more technical subjects (such as computers or engineering) but not necessarily knowledgeable about the technical subject(s) they are interested in. So even though a nerd might have a keen interest in say, computers, that doesn’t necessarily mean they are knowledgeable about the subject but a geek would be. Bottom line, if you need someone to help you with something, talk to a geek not a nerd.
 
    I’m sure if you were speak to the average person on the street, they would say that the two terms mean the same thing and are interchangeable. And that is the way they seem to be used most of the time. And sometimes I’ve been guilty of this. Although I’ve always preferred the term “geek” because “nerd” seemed derogatory and “geek” seemed to infer intelligence to me. Looking at the dictionary meanings, that does seem to be the case.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : The difference between a nerd and a geek can be tricky. Some people may get offended if you call then a nerd or a geek. While on the other hand others may take it as a complement. I think there is two good ways to determine the difference between a nerd and a geek. Those two ways are based upon their common interest and the way they present themselves.

    Let’s first take a look at the obvious the way they prevent themselves. Nerds typically will dress up a little bit more than geeks. You may see a nerd in a polo shirt or with dress shoes. Not all nerds will wear glasses, but some will. While on the other hand geeks will wear glasses and typically wear clothing that represents their interest. So maybe they might have an Angry Bird T-Shirt on if they like that game.

    Lastly let’s take a look at their interest and the way they act. Geeks will typically stay with one interest and they will know everything that there is to know about it. Nerds will usually have more of an interest in academic areas. Since nerds typically are interested in academic areas, it might be more difficult for them to interact socially than geeks. 
    If I would have to place myself between a nerd and geek, I would probably consider myself as a nerd. Mainly because of my interests and the way that I dress.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : People use the terms geeks and nerds and even dork interchangeable, but there is are critical differences between them. Geeks and nerds may seem very similar, sometimes even identical when it comes to intelligence, but that’s just from people’s ignorance of what those terms truly mean. The popular series The Big Bang Theory is a perfect subject to show the differences between these terms.

    A good example of being a nerd is how Sheldon acts when at work or at home when he is incredibly focused on physics. Nerds are incredibly intelligent people that become obsessed with one or two particular subjects that they excel at. Most are introverted and antisocial because they prefer academic and professional pursuits instead of social ones. They may not be social butterflies but they make up for it by becoming extremely successful earning 6 figure salaries.

    As for geeks, an example of that is how the guys on Big Bang Theory are obsessed with comic books, video games, and other less useful activities. That’s where the term “geeking out” comes from. Geeks tend to focus a lot of their lives around one or more obsessions, whether they be videogames, TV shows, artist pursuits, or any other things that might not be seen as useful to non-geeky people. Geeks however are much more social than nerds and are not necessarily socially-awkward like many nerds might be.

    There’s a very simple way to state this difference to sum it all up. Nerds obsess over things that they can make money on and are usually anti-social, while geeks obsess over more trivial things that they can’t really make money on but are much more social. And dorks are just dorks. Very socially awkward and not necessarily intelligent at all. So please don’t confuse the intelligent nerds and geeks with dorks. Geeks and nerds are proud to be what they are.
