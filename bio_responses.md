- Geek vs. Nerd      : The difference between a geek and a nerd is one that has been difficult to discern for decades. Formerly terms that would bring shame and ridicule upon those who bore them, they have now 
they are worn almost as a badge of honor. The differences between the two may seem minute and obscure, but to those truly looking they may as well be as large as the grand canyon.

    Typically the most obvious difference between a geek and a nerd is physical. While a geek may be seen typically wearing jeans and a t-shirt containing an image or reference to one of their passions, a nerd will more often be seen wearing slacks and a button down shirt as well as possibly a bow tie that is not being worn ironically, but because they think it looks "swell." Also you are less likely to see nerds having social interactions outside of those they know very well, due to a general sense of insecurity caused by poor experiences in high school; whereas geeks can be seen mastering social interactions from working in a record store to tending a bar. But enough about physical and psychological differences, the real difference lies in personality.

    While a nerd may be a master of one thing, such as programming or chess or playing text based adventure games, a geek may have multiple talents, some better than others, but none being remarkably poor. Geeks also tend to have more of a fascination with things such as movies, music, books, TV shows or cars, while nerds tend to have a fascination with the technology and principles these rely upon. To summarize the differences in a very simple explanation using The Big Bang Theory, Leonard is a geek while Sheldon is a nerd.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : I firmly believe I am a geek. Not a nerd. I believe that geek are extremely smart about certain subjects, mostly what they enjoy or is popular. Geeks desire to have knowledge in many areas and desire for overall knowledge.

    I also believe that geeks enjoy recreational events more so than nerds. I believe geeks will use they're knowledge for board games, trivia, or video games. Nerds would be more for knowledge for bettering oneself.

    Geeks I think are also more out going about their interests. They will wear or show off what they love in everyday life. Nerds may keep their interests more so to them selves.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : This has been a much debated concept in my house within the past 2 years, as my mother and her boyfriend are both database administrators for UPMC, and are both self proclaimed geeks.Thus, they take great offense when called nerds. To me, a nerd and a geek are less of a class of person, and more of adjective that can be used to describe nerdy or geeky people.

    Being geeky will usually refer to having more obsessive tendencies, trying to be very well versed in their hobbies. They often will spend a lot of time trying to do different things that they love, whether they like to geek over cartoons such as Adventure Time or the Regular Show, or like to spend hours playing games on their computer or game console.

    Being nerdy, on the other hand, seems to me like it can be used to describe someone who is unusually good at hobbies that both geeks and nerds share. Seeing as so many computer related fields are heavily based on math, both sides have plenty of practice with many different fields. However, like most shows and movies show, nerds are usually known for being good at math. I think it’s less about being smart, but being adaptive, and good at picking up things like that quickly.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : Everyone who is a Nerd is Geek, but everyone who is a Geek is not a Nerd. Geeks and Nerds are people who are passionate or knowledgeable about a specific thing or hobby. The difference between a Geek and a Nerd is what they are interested in.
    
    A Geek is someone who is obsessed with any kind of hobby or intellectual pursuit. They could be interested in anything from cars and motors to mathematics and learning, or anything in between. A Nerd on the other hand is someone obsessed with a more specific range of hobbies or pursuits. Those interest are usually something relating to technology, games, or fictitious media.
    
    In the past, a difference between Geeks and Nerds would have been how social their hobby was. A Geek would have been someone who is more social, and would not have been immediately recognizable as a Geek. A Nerd would have been someone who was less social, and would be easily recognized as a Nerd. However, in modern times it is much more "mainstream" for people to be Nerds making this distinction obsolete.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : The terms "Geek" and "Nerd" can have various meanings to different segments of society. I believe the the the terms are nearly interchangeable, with a few differences.

    I take the term geek to represent a various group of people.  These groups are very knowledgeable about a specific subject. Whether that subject be computers, video games, comics etc.  They would be able to tell you almost anything about the subject they are interested in.  Also they are more able to socialize with each other; hence the develop of "cons", so there they have a place to meet and exchange ideas.

    Nerds on the other hand, are often less socially adaptable.  Then tend to stay to themselves or a small circle of friends.  They tend to have a vast knowledge base that covers many subjects, not focusing on any one topic.  Also they tend to develop a ritual of habits that they tend to stick with like an OCD.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : It is sometimes difficult to discern between "Geek" and "Nerd," as they share similar traits.  Sometimes people use the terms interchangeably, however right or wrong that may be.  Also, they may have varying connotations that can change based on the context in which they were used.  But, it can be argued that there is a difference.

    When I think of a geek, I think of Steve Urkel from the 90's sitcom Family Matters.  He's a young, unkempt, clumsy, socially awkward guy who struggles to fit in.  He can be considered a "goody two-shoes."  He has interests in things that most "normal" people wouldn't have.  He even has the stereotypical fashion traits down to the odd prescription glasses with a strap attached.  But he has traits that can make him likable.  He's incredibly smart, he has good intentions, and he makes others around him learn valuable life lessons.
    
    Also, it should be noted that the term geek is most commonly associated with people interested in computers.  For example, "computer geek," or if you're in the market for help with your computer, you can visit the Geek Squad.
    
    When I think of a nerd, I think of someone who is also smart, but less socially awkward.  They may also have less common interests, but they are less technical in nature and often more social in nature.  A nerd is more likely to be considered a hipster and is more concerned with their physical appearance or how their interests reflect on them amongst others like them.  For instance, you will more likely find a nerd sitting at Starbucks with their Apple laptop wearing a scarf, non-prescription glasses, and their bicycle locked up outside.  When I think of a nerd, I think of someone like comedian Chris Hardwick, host of the show @midnight.  After all, his Twitter handle is @nerdist.  George Takei also comes to mind.
    
    Most importantly though, as with many traits, geek vs. nerd is not cut and dry.  They cannot be held to strict criteria.  Rather, the difference between a geek and a nerd follows a spectrum.  As for me, I probably follow closely along the line separating the two.  Interestingly, the sitcom The Big Bang Theory can probably best illustrate the spectrum.  Howard and Bernadette would probably be more on the nerd side, Sheldon and Amy Farrah Fowler would be more on the geek side, and Penny, Leonard, and Raj would be somewhere in the middle.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : Let's explore this topic by comparing two iconic TV characters that epitomize each of these dynamic groups, Lenard and Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory.  Lenard will be our geek, and Sheldon our nerd.  This comparison will show that geeks tend to be more social the nerds.  

    Nerds have a hard time connecting with people who are not also nerds.  Lenard on the Big Bang theory has a varied group of friends.  Sheldon is part of this group, but struggles to connect with non-nerds.  An example of this is Sheldon's constant degradation of Howard for his lack of a PhD.  Sheldon is not able to fully connect with anyone that he does not feel shares his mental capacity (which is just about everyone besides Stephen Hawking and George Lucas.)  Also, Sheldon has only dated Amy Farrah Fowler, a fellow nerd, while Lenard has dated a wide variety of women, most notably Penny who is neither a geek nor a nerd.  

    In conclusion, geeks are more social than nerds because they are able to connect with other geeks, nerds and the occasional person who does not fall into either category, while nerds have trouble connecting with anyone who does not fall under the nerd categorization.

    (Hope you are familiar with The Big Bang Theory.)

- Geek vs. Nerd      : The definition of a geek is a person who engages in or discusses computer-related tasks obsessively or with great attention to technical detail. I myself define a geek as a person the finds technology interesting and makes technology part of their everyday life whether that be part of their job or just a hobby.

    The definition for a nerd is an intelligent but single-minded person obsessed with a nonsocial hobby or pursuit. Where I define it as a person that finds the pursuit of information their hobby. They may be less sociable but many come together in groups as friends.

    The deference between the two can be a real gray area. A nerd likes information and a computer can be a very useful tool to gather information and to be able to use a computer to its fullest potential a “nerd” may want to become very familiar with the technology. A “geek” can cross over into the other side of things as well for to be able to keep your technology up to date you will want to learn as much information from many different sources and topics. The extremes of the two aren’t as prevalent as they used to be for the “geek” and the “nerd” are becoming as one group.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : Are you a "Geek" or a "Nerd"? The term "geek" is found more acceptable than "nerd" in some circles, while in other circles you will find quite the opposite. A nerd may not want to be called a geek, but a geek may not want to be referred to as a nerd either.There are academic, social and lifestyle differences between geeks and nerds that we will explore below.

    A geek is someone who is passionate about a particular subject and has become an expert in that field. A geek is usually more outgoing with better mainstream social skills than a nerd but can also come across as weird to others who do not share their passions. Geeks are life smart. They come with experience and are often self taught. Geeks tend to dress according to their field of expertise, often in sneakers and jeans. Geeks are more laid back with a different type of confidence than a nerd. Geeks tend to be more creative and fun in life and their choice of career.

    A nerd is usually very studious in academics, they are more book smart than life smart.  Nerds tend to gather knowledge on many topics. They are technical in nature, enjoying complex issues and strategizing.  Nerds are often quiet, reserved and introverted. They like a sense of order and tend to be more conservative with everything they do.

    So, are you a geek or a nerd?

    I think the above graphic is a good starting point for the topic of geek versus nerd. While geeks and nerds may share a similar scholarly obsession the social ineptitude is where the main difference resides. I personally have always viewed the two on an intellectual par. While nerds on the one hand may have the slight advantage in the knowledge department, they lack the social skills to properly apply their knowledge. Sadly leaving them perhaps the most knowledgeable and tech savvy people you will never know. Geeks on the other hand have the knowledge and the ability to apply their knowledge in a social environment. Thus when I think of people who teach computers (no offense), or run IT departments, or even myself I have always thought geek. As we are out and about in the world talking, interacting, and applying our knowledge.
 
    In fact, with technology ever advancing and people carrying what is basically a personal computer in their pockets (smart phones) it has almost become chic to be geek. Everyone, wants to do social media, check their calendars, or check their email, and everyone wants the newest “cool” apps. So it seems that technology has afforded everyone the chance to be a little geeky, and try to one up each other, be it with cool new apps, or tricks, or even just having the latest greatest smart phone model.
 
    Now while doing research, (yes I did research) it seems the term geek has been completely transformed into a slang term for the obsessed. Terms such as sports geek, car geek, or cooking geek are now regularly used to describe someone who is obsessed and knowledgeable in a particular field. Whether that field is tech savvy or not, and even regardless of whether that person would be considered intelligent outside of that particular field. Hard to imagine a geek, having little knowledge on tech subjects, but say a car geek, may honestly only be knowledgably about cars. Make, models, repairing, restoring, etc. They may or may not even be able to operate a computer or smart phone, yet they are the new geek. Now, being a non-traditional student (politically correct for 39 year old student) makes me of a slightly older age, and to think of the words sports and geek being used together makes me realize the term geek has certainly evolved since I was originally in school.
 
    Now the more satirical end of the geek versus nerd debate was found via a google image search. It appears the new typical geek, is now portrayed as a knowledgeable, but also an all about me kind of person. Attempting to show off what they know and the new gadgets they may have. Almost a technological narcissist if you will. Look at me, look at me, while they pull out the newest mini tablet from their designer back pack pocket. All while nerds are still portrayed as the socially inept yet technologically over knowledgeable, just as we remember them. So while nerds remain nerds, geeks have become a moving target evolving over time like a toddler learning to walk.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : I would have to say that a Geek is someone who knows a lot about technology and gets excited about it. They know everything about what’s out there from Computers to Phones. They live breathe tech, gadgets, oddly things. I consider myself to be a Geek because I love new techy stuff like Smart phones and Gaming computers.

    I would say a nerd is someone that knows how technology works. From ram to processors. They make it their business or mission in life to improve and speed up technology. A nerd is who I aspire to be someday. I want to understand how the things I play with work together and how I could improve them.

    This is my understanding of what a Geek is and what a Nerd is and what the main difference between the two. I hope one day I can become a nerd instead of a geek and create something new for my geek brethren.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : I think there is a distinct difference between the word "Geek" and the word "Nerd." A geek, in the past at least, used to refer to someone who was enthusiastic (or in some cases, obsessed) about something. Like a "true fan," as opposed to your average, everyday fan. A Trekkie could be considered a type of this form of "geek."

    In recent times, however, the word seems to have gained a new meaning. Most of the time, when people refer to themselves as a "geek," it's a sort of tongue-in-cheek way of saying they may or may not like things that could qualify under the other definition of geek. In other words, to true "geeks" they wouldn't even qualify to use the word, but it has nonetheless been used widely in our culture. Anyone with glasses seems to find the word fitting for themselves, regardless of their interests.
    
    As for "nerd," I think it refers more to the nature of other interests, not pertaining to movies, books, and so forth. A "nerdy" interest could be something like math, heavy science, astronomy, that stuff. Programming could be considered a "nerdy" interests by some, though in my particular opinion it doesn't really qualify. With the widespread use of technology, including in entertainment in the form of video games, it seems odd to me to consider programming "nerdy."

- Geek vs. Nerd      : People generally use the terms "Geek" and "Nerd" interchangeably to describe a person who may be a little socially awkward or too intelligent for their own good.  These people don't know that there is a difference between the two terms, and that the person they use that term on doesn't take it as an insult unless they have used the wrong one.

    A person who can be labelled a "geek" is someone who is rabidly obsessed by every detail of a certain subject that is usually not considered mainstream.  For example, someone who knows the main characters in the cantina scene in Star Wars: A New Hope could be described as a Star Wars fan, however, someone who can identify even the background characters in that scene by name and back-story could be described as a Star Wars geek.

    A person who can be labelled a "nerd" is someone who generally strives to understand and educate themselves about things that are not common knowledge.  For example, someone who has to use Microsoft Excel for their job may learn how to do the necessary functions to create the desired spreadsheet, however, a nerd would research all of the functions and formulas to create a spreadsheet that is far more efficient.

    Now that "geeks" and "nerds" have been defined, and examples have been given as to how they are different than "normal" people, I will explain how they differ from each other.  Geeks usually have certain areas of expertise, whereas nerds try to understand the entire field.  A nerd might appreciate both Star Wars and Star Trek for what they have brought to the science fiction genre, but a geek will choose one to adore while despising the other.  While a nerd will try to understand the same subject as a geek, a nerd will never live and breathe that subject the same as a geek does.  There may be some differences between the two, and they may argue there is more, the truth also is that every geek is part nerd, and every nerd is part geek.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : The difference between a geek and a nerd may vary from person to person. A nerd in my opinion is someone who is extremely interested in something. It can be anything, I consider myself a nerd in more than one catagory. I love comic books/superheroes. My favorite comic character is Black Adam from the DC Universe. I also consider myself a music nerd.  I love all kinds of music. My favorite singers/artists are Justin Timberlake, Amy Winehouse, Drake, Sammy Johnson, and Otis Redding to name a few. I also aspire to be a singer/musician someday. I was the lead singer of a blues band for a while and I loved it. I also consider myself a fashion nerd. You'll learn from seeing me in class that I take my appearance very seriously. Many people think that men who take fashion seriously are metro, or gay and I think both of those are terrible stereotypes. My saying is "You look good, you feel good. You feel good, you do good." A nerd is basically someone who takes their interests and incorporates them into their life in a way that shows them off as a person. 

    A geek on the other hand is someone who people consider a "loser." They're very unkempt, and messy. A perfect depiction of a geek to me is the character Wendell from the television series "Key & Peele." A geek is very impersonal, they lack the necessary people skills to adapt in public settings. They're very intelligent to the point it makes others uncomfortable. They use their knowledge to make others feel inferior to them.

    While many people consider geeks, and nerds to be one in the same. I believe that a nerd is the better of the two. In conclusion, I believe a nerd is someone who uses their interests as a way to meet others like them. While a geek is someone who uses them to set themselves apart.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : I never really thought about the difference beetween geeks, and nerds, because to me, they are close to the same thing. But if i was guessing, i would say that Geeks are more allong the lines of people like us, say programmers, or extreamly computer literate people. Whereas nerds are more like people that just hand out and play MTG, or D&D.

    But i personally think that everyone pretty much became a nerd the second that we all started carrying around a mini computer in our pocket all day long, that most people cant take their eyes off for more than 10 seconds.

    But in the end, it don't matter if you're a geek, or a nerd, because one way or another, you're an awesome person, and most likely not boring in the slightest.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : I’ve never looked up these words in the dictionary so I may be surprised at what they actually mean. The online Merriam-Webster dictionary definitions for geek and nerd are:
 
    Geek:  a person who is socially awkward and unpopular : a usually intelligent person who does not fit in with other people : a person who is very interested in and knows a lot about a particular field or activity
 
    Nerd:  a person who behaves awkwardly around other people and usually has unstylish clothes, hair, etc. : a person who is very interested in technical subjects, computers, etc.
 
    No surprises, they are very similar to one another. Both geeks and nerds can be socially awkward resulting in being unpopular and may not look or dress stylishly. This is something they may have in common. I say “may” because not all geeks or nerds have these problems. I don’t believe there are any studies that report the percentage of such people that are socially awkward, unpopular, or do not look or dress stylishly but I have known a number of people who I would consider a geek or a nerd who do not display any of those traits. But then again, those traits are quite subjective.
 
    The last parts of the definitions are where the terms differ a bit. A geek is not necessarily a nerd but a nerd can also be a geek. A geek can be interested and knowledgeable about a particular field or activity whereas a nerd would be interested in one or more technical subjects (such as computers or engineering) but not necessarily knowledgeable about the technical subject(s) they are interested in. So even though a nerd might have a keen interest in say, computers, that doesn’t necessarily mean they are knowledgeable about the subject but a geek would be. Bottom line, if you need someone to help you with something, talk to a geek not a nerd.
 
    I’m sure if you were speak to the average person on the street, they would say that the two terms mean the same thing and are interchangeable. And that is the way they seem to be used most of the time. And sometimes I’ve been guilty of this. Although I’ve always preferred the term “geek” because “nerd” seemed derogatory and “geek” seemed to infer intelligence to me. Looking at the dictionary meanings, that does seem to be the case.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : The difference between a nerd and a geek can be tricky. Some people may get offended if you call then a nerd or a geek. While on the other hand others may take it as a complement. I think there is two good ways to determine the difference between a nerd and a geek. Those two ways are based upon their common interest and the way they present themselves.

    Let’s first take a look at the obvious the way they prevent themselves. Nerds typically will dress up a little bit more than geeks. You may see a nerd in a polo shirt or with dress shoes. Not all nerds will wear glasses, but some will. While on the other hand geeks will wear glasses and typically wear clothing that represents their interest. So maybe they might have an Angry Bird T-Shirt on if they like that game.

    Lastly let’s take a look at their interest and the way they act. Geeks will typically stay with one interest and they will know everything that there is to know about it. Nerds will usually have more of an interest in academic areas. Since nerds typically are interested in academic areas, it might be more difficult for them to interact socially than geeks. 
    If I would have to place myself between a nerd and geek, I would probably consider myself as a nerd. Mainly because of my interests and the way that I dress.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : People use the terms geeks and nerds and even dork interchangeable, but there is are critical differences between them. Geeks and nerds may seem very similar, sometimes even identical when it comes to intelligence, but that’s just from people’s ignorance of what those terms truly mean. The popular series The Big Bang Theory is a perfect subject to show the differences between these terms.

    A good example of being a nerd is how Sheldon acts when at work or at home when he is incredibly focused on physics. Nerds are incredibly intelligent people that become obsessed with one or two particular subjects that they excel at. Most are introverted and antisocial because they prefer academic and professional pursuits instead of social ones. They may not be social butterflies but they make up for it by becoming extremely successful earning 6 figure salaries.

    As for geeks, an example of that is how the guys on Big Bang Theory are obsessed with comic books, video games, and other less useful activities. That’s where the term “geeking out” comes from. Geeks tend to focus a lot of their lives around one or more obsessions, whether they be videogames, TV shows, artist pursuits, or any other things that might not be seen as useful to non-geeky people. Geeks however are much more social than nerds and are not necessarily socially-awkward like many nerds might be.

    There’s a very simple way to state this difference to sum it all up. Nerds obsess over things that they can make money on and are usually anti-social, while geeks obsess over more trivial things that they can’t really make money on but are much more social. And dorks are just dorks. Very socially awkward and not necessarily intelligent at all. So please don’t confuse the intelligent nerds and geeks with dorks. Geeks and nerds are proud to be what they are.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : In my opinion, the difference between geeks and nerds lies in the functionality between the two.  Geeks and nerds are both types of people that have an almost obsessive nature.  Geeks obsess over something that is useful, usually that the average person does not fully understand.  Nerds obsess over things that are pretty much useless in everyday life, but cool nonetheless.  There is usually a degree of judgement passed onto geeks and nerds by people that don't understand their obsessions.

    Computer scientists, for example would fall under the category of geeks.  Computer scientists know the innerworkings of computers forwards and backwards.  They obsess with understanding how computers work and how to manipulate them.  Obviously, this is useful knowledge, but people are still inclined to pass judgement on computer scientists because they do share the obsession.  However, computer scientists are certainly not the only types of geeks.  Archaeologists can be considered geeks. Mathmeticians can be geeks. Even auto-mechanics can be geeks if they have an overly sufficient knowledge of engineering and physics related to automobiles. I guess the best way to identify a geek is to ask yourself, "Can this person's weird obsession be a career?".

    Nerds, on the other hand, are obsessed with things that are basically useless.  People that do not fall into the categories of "geeks" or "nerds" generally do not understand the obsessions of nerds.  Examples of nerd obsessions are as follows:

    - Dungeons and Dragons
    - Star Wars
    - World of Warcraft
    - Minecraft
    - Star Trek
    - Magic The Gathering
    - Pokemon
    - Final Fantasy
    - Any comic book series
    - Any anime
