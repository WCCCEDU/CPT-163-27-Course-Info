- Geek vs. Nerd      :  I think there is a distinct difference between the word "Geek" and the word "Nerd." A geek, in the past at least, used to refer to someone who was enthusiastic (or in some cases, obsessed) about something. Like a "true fan," as opposed to your average, everyday fan. A Trekkie could be considered a type of this form of "geek."

    In recent times, however, the word seems to have gained a new meaning. Most of the time, when people refer to themselves as a "geek," it's a sort of tongue-in-cheek way of saying they may or may not like things that could qualify under the other definition of geek. In other words, to true "geeks" they wouldn't even qualify to use the word, but it has nonetheless been used widely in our culture. Anyone with glasses seems to find the word fitting for themselves, regardless of their interests.
    
    As for "nerd," I think it refers more to the nature of other interests, not pertaining to movies, books, and so forth. A "nerdy" interest could be something like math, heavy science, astronomy, that stuff. Programming could be considered a "nerdy" interests by some, though in my particular opinion it doesn't really qualify. With the widespread use of technology, including in entertainment in the form of video games, it seems odd to me to consider programming "nerdy."

- Geek vs. Nerd      : People generally use the terms "Geek" and "Nerd" interchangeably to describe a person who may be a little socially awkward or too intelligent for their own good.  These people don't know that there is a difference between the two terms, and that the person they use that term on doesn't take it as an insult unless they have used the wrong one.

    A person who can be labelled a "geek" is someone who is rabidly obsessed by every detail of a certain subject that is usually not considered mainstream.  For example, someone who knows the main characters in the cantina scene in Star Wars: A New Hope could be described as a Star Wars fan, however, someone who can identify even the background characters in that scene by name and back-story could be described as a Star Wars geek.

    A person who can be labelled a "nerd" is someone who generally strives to understand and educate themselves about things that are not common knowledge.  For example, someone who has to use Microsoft Excel for their job may learn how to do the necessary functions to create the desired spreadsheet, however, a nerd would research all of the functions and formulas to create a spreadsheet that is far more efficient.

    Now that "geeks" and "nerds" have been defined, and examples have been given as to how they are different than "normal" people, I will explain how they differ from each other.  Geeks usually have certain areas of expertise, whereas nerds try to understand the entire field.  A nerd might appreciate both Star Wars and Star Trek for what they have brought to the science fiction genre, but a geek will choose one to adore while despising the other.  While a nerd will try to understand the same subject as a geek, a nerd will never live and breathe that subject the same as a geek does.  There may be some differences between the two, and they may argue there is more, the truth also is that every geek is part nerd, and every nerd is part geek.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : The difference between a geek and a nerd may vary from person to person. A nerd in my opinion is someone who is extremely interested in something. It can be anything, I consider myself a nerd in more than one catagory. I love comic books/superheroes. My favorite comic character is Black Adam from the DC Universe. I also consider myself a music nerd.  I love all kinds of music. My favorite singers/artists are Justin Timberlake, Amy Winehouse, Drake, Sammy Johnson, and Otis Redding to name a few. I also aspire to be a singer/musician someday. I was the lead singer of a blues band for a while and I loved it. I also consider myself a fashion nerd. You'll learn from seeing me in class that I take my appearance very seriously. Many people think that men who take fashion seriously are metro, or gay and I think both of those are terrible stereotypes. My saying is "You look good, you feel good. You feel good, you do good." A nerd is basically someone who takes their interests and incorporates them into their life in a way that shows them off as a person. 

    A geek on the other hand is someone who people consider a "loser." They're very unkempt, and messy. A perfect depiction of a geek to me is the character Wendell from the television series "Key & Peele." A geek is very impersonal, they lack the necessary people skills to adapt in public settings. They're very intelligent to the point it makes others uncomfortable. They use their knowledge to make others feel inferior to them.

    While many people consider geeks, and nerds to be one in the same. I believe that a nerd is the better of the two. In conclusion, I believe a nerd is someone who uses their interests as a way to meet others like them. While a geek is someone who uses them to set themselves apart.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : I never really thought about the difference beetween geeks, and nerds, because to me, they are close to the same thing. But if i was guessing, i would say that Geeks are more allong the lines of people like us, say programmers, or extreamly computer literate people. Whereas nerds are more like people that just hand out and play MTG, or D&D.

    But i personally think that everyone pretty much became a nerd the second that we all started carrying around a mini computer in our pocket all day long, that most people cant take their eyes off for more than 10 seconds.

    But in the end, it don't matter if you're a geek, or a nerd, because one way or another, you're an awesome person, and most likely not boring in the slightest.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : I’ve never looked up these words in the dictionary so I may be surprised at what they actually mean. The online Merriam-Webster dictionary definitions for geek and nerd are:
 
    Geek:  a person who is socially awkward and unpopular : a usually intelligent person who does not fit in with other people : a person who is very interested in and knows a lot about a particular field or activity
 
    Nerd:  a person who behaves awkwardly around other people and usually has unstylish clothes, hair, etc. : a person who is very interested in technical subjects, computers, etc.
 
    No surprises, they are very similar to one another. Both geeks and nerds can be socially awkward resulting in being unpopular and may not look or dress stylishly. This is something they may have in common. I say “may” because not all geeks or nerds have these problems. I don’t believe there are any studies that report the percentage of such people that are socially awkward, unpopular, or do not look or dress stylishly but I have known a number of people who I would consider a geek or a nerd who do not display any of those traits. But then again, those traits are quite subjective.
 
    The last parts of the definitions are where the terms differ a bit. A geek is not necessarily a nerd but a nerd can also be a geek. A geek can be interested and knowledgeable about a particular field or activity whereas a nerd would be interested in one or more technical subjects (such as computers or engineering) but not necessarily knowledgeable about the technical subject(s) they are interested in. So even though a nerd might have a keen interest in say, computers, that doesn’t necessarily mean they are knowledgeable about the subject but a geek would be. Bottom line, if you need someone to help you with something, talk to a geek not a nerd.
 
    I’m sure if you were speak to the average person on the street, they would say that the two terms mean the same thing and are interchangeable. And that is the way they seem to be used most of the time. And sometimes I’ve been guilty of this. Although I’ve always preferred the term “geek” because “nerd” seemed derogatory and “geek” seemed to infer intelligence to me. Looking at the dictionary meanings, that does seem to be the case.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : The difference between a nerd and a geek can be tricky. Some people may get offended if you call then a nerd or a geek. While on the other hand others may take it as a complement. I think there is two good ways to determine the difference between a nerd and a geek. Those two ways are based upon their common interest and the way they present themselves.

    Let’s first take a look at the obvious the way they prevent themselves. Nerds typically will dress up a little bit more than geeks. You may see a nerd in a polo shirt or with dress shoes. Not all nerds will wear glasses, but some will. While on the other hand geeks will wear glasses and typically wear clothing that represents their interest. So maybe they might have an Angry Bird T-Shirt on if they like that game.

    Lastly let’s take a look at their interest and the way they act. Geeks will typically stay with one interest and they will know everything that there is to know about it. Nerds will usually have more of an interest in academic areas. Since nerds typically are interested in academic areas, it might be more difficult for them to interact socially than geeks. 
    If I would have to place myself between a nerd and geek, I would probably consider myself as a nerd. Mainly because of my interests and the way that I dress.

- Geek vs. Nerd      : People use the terms geeks and nerds and even dork interchangeable, but there is are critical differences between them. Geeks and nerds may seem very similar, sometimes even identical when it comes to intelligence, but that’s just from people’s ignorance of what those terms truly mean. The popular series The Big Bang Theory is a perfect subject to show the differences between these terms.

    A good example of being a nerd is how Sheldon acts when at work or at home when he is incredibly focused on physics. Nerds are incredibly intelligent people that become obsessed with one or two particular subjects that they excel at. Most are introverted and antisocial because they prefer academic and professional pursuits instead of social ones. They may not be social butterflies but they make up for it by becoming extremely successful earning 6 figure salaries.

    As for geeks, an example of that is how the guys on Big Bang Theory are obsessed with comic books, video games, and other less useful activities. That’s where the term “geeking out” comes from. Geeks tend to focus a lot of their lives around one or more obsessions, whether they be videogames, TV shows, artist pursuits, or any other things that might not be seen as useful to non-geeky people. Geeks however are much more social than nerds and are not necessarily socially-awkward like many nerds might be.

    There’s a very simple way to state this difference to sum it all up. Nerds obsess over things that they can make money on and are usually anti-social, while geeks obsess over more trivial things that they can’t really make money on but are much more social. And dorks are just dorks. Very socially awkward and not necessarily intelligent at all. So please don’t confuse the intelligent nerds and geeks with dorks. Geeks and nerds are proud to be what they are.
