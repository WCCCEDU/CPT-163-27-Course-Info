Java Test 1 (9-16-2015)

Name:_______________________________
<br/><br/>

1. This is a valid Java function identify as many parts as you can. (You can draw lines to the parts)
    ```java
    
    public static int getNumber(int number){
    
        return number;
    
    }
    ```



2. Draw the number line and mathamatical equivalence (eg: a < x < c) __for__ a loop that that will iterate 11 times.
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
3. Name the three components of a for loop?
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
4. What is the difference between a `while` and a `do while` loop? What hyphenated word do we use to describe the behavior of these loops?
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
5. Describe in a short sentence what is happening in this statement: `int number = 4`
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
6. On a seperate sheet of paper write a program that uses a loop within a standard Java entry point that will tell me if the following values are palindromes. (A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward.)

`Sample input: pallindrome`
<br/>
`Sample input: balooninoolab`
